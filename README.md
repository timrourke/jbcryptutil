# jbcryptutil

A CLI for hashing passwords with org.mindrot.jbcrypt

## What?

This is a dumb little project to use the org.mindrot.jbcrypt Java library for
hashing passwords on the command line.

There are myriad better ways to do this, use them instead.

## Use

- Install Docker
- Run `bin/build.sh`
- Hash a password: `bin/encrypt.sh "some gnarly password"`
